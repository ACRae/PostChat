In this project, we have developed a comprehensive application that integrates various components, including a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model, a web API, and an Android application frontend. The aim of the project was to provide users with a seamless and efficient solution for communicating using digital postcards and to expand our knowledge of the AI world as we go.

In terms of future work, there are several areas that can be further improved and expanded upon. Bug fixes and performance optimizations should be prioritized to ensure the stability and efficiency of the application. Additionally, further testing, including unit testing and integration testing, should be conducted to identify and address any potential issues.

Furthermore, the application can be enhanced by implementing additional functionalities and features. This may include integrating social sharing capabilities, enabling users to share their postcards on social media platforms.

Overall, this project has demonstrated the successful integration of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) technology, a web API, and an Android application frontend to create a comprehensive postcard sending system. By leveraging these technologies, users can easily personalize and send their handwritten postcards, making the process more efficient and convenient. With continued development and refinement, the application has the potential to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable communication process.
