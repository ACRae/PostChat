\noindent

There is a large library of platforms and apps that allow one to invite people to an event. These platforms, however, have some downsides, for example, splitting expenses of an event is hard to do on those platforms, they require new users to make an account and activating it, are not available on multiple platforms, among other issues. The goal of this project is to develop a new platform that tackles these disadvantages. This way the group implemented a new solution using modern platforms (such as ASP.NET CORE and Xamarin) that can be used by a large number of people on modern devices and can later be expanded to new environments that might be created. The group was presented with some challenges that had to be overcome, like the authentication without account creation using multiple providers, the notifications mechanism, or the code sharing between platforms. The result is a new application supported by a Web API without the need to create a new account on another platform, using the already existing accounts on other services like Facebook and Microsoftâ€™s Outlook, for example.
