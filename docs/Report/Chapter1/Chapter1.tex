While there are some applications that allow for the creation of events, invitations and publishing, none of them focus on what really happens during and in the planning of an event.

In a real case scenario like the organization of a \textit{party} type of event, there are some important factors to take into account. For this type of events it's possible to list some basic needs like: budget management (expenses like food and drinks), location, or entertainment (such as music).

The purpose of this project consists of simplifying the planning and management of events having the focus on people collaboration through a mobile application, while keeping it possible to expand to other platforms.

The proposed solution is comprised of a Web API and a client application. The Web API is supported by .NET CORE MVC and a PostgreSQL SQL database engine. The client application is built using Xamarin Forms, with aim especially for Android devices and Windows devices. All operations (such as creating events, items, tasks, etc...) happen in the API and the client application communicates with it using HTTP.

The remainder of the report is organized in seven chapters. Chapter 2 presents the State of the Art. In Chapter 3, the project functionality is presented. Chapter 4 describes the development support used in the project. In Chapter 5 the project roadmap is analyzed. Chapter 6 draws some conclusions and gives pointers to future work.
